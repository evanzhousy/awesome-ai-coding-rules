# Webapp production error check (last 24h)

Pull **past 24 hours** of production errors from every error channel, cluster them, and report what to fix. Investigate only — do not implement code, change observability routing, or resolve/suppress issues unless the user explicitly asks after the report.

## Channels to check

| Channel | Role | What to query |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PostHog Error Tracking** | Browser + backend `$exception` issues | Active issues in project **300646** (`app.tradingflow.com`), window `-24h` |
| **Better Stack Errors** | Durable error patterns / stacks | `WebFullStack-Errors` application — top patterns for the same window |
| **Better Stack Info** (optional) | Diagnosis context around errors | `WebFullStack-Info` logs — `correlationId`, `scope`, `operation`, `requestUrl` when a cluster needs more context |
| **Discord** | Human alert feed | Glance only when PostHog/Better Stack need a quick cross-check of recent P0 noise; not a primary query source |

Policy detail: [`ops/harness/observability-rules.md`](../harness/observability-rules.md). Errors route as `error.P0` / `error.P1` to Discord + PostHog + Better Stack. Split PostHog issues by `channel` = `frontend` | `backend` when ranking blast radius.

## When to use

- “What broke in prod in the last 24 hours?”
- Daily / ad-hoc error health across PostHog + Better Stack
- Need clusters, confidence, and a smallest safe fix plan before coding

## When not to use

- Product analytics, funnels, retention → PostHog product analytics runbooks
- One local stack with no production correlation → debug that path directly
- “Just fix it” with no evidence → confirm the production signal first, or get explicit approval to skip triage

## Workflow

Default window: **last 24 hours**. Override only if the user names a different range.

### 1. Resolve Better Stack IDs

Call live Better Stack tools first (do not hardcode stale IDs):

1. List applications → pick **`WebFullStack-Errors`** → record `application_id`
2. List sources → pick **`WebFullStack-Info`** → record `source_id`
3. Call errors query help / instructions for that `application_id` before writing SQL

Last observed (may be stale): Errors `2412994`, Info `2357910`. Always resolve fresh.

Live Cursor tool names on `user-betterstack` are typically: `applications`, `sources`, `errors`, `error`, `query`, `errors_query_help`, `query_help`. Older docs may say `telemetry_*` — map to the live names.

### 2. PostHog — list active issues

1. Confirm project **300646** / `app.tradingflow.com`. If the connected MCP project differs, state that as a blocker (do not treat empty results as zero errors).
2. Prefer Error Tracking list tools (`query-error-tracking-issues-list` or whatever the live schema exposes).
3. Defaults: `status=active`, `date_from=-24h`, order by `occurrences` DESC, limit ~25–50.
4. For top issues, pull detail / sampled events for `channel`, `scope`, `$pathname` / `$current_url`, stack, users/sessions.

**HogQL fallback** when only query access exists:

```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  properties.$exception_type AS exception_type,
  properties.$exception_message AS exception_message,
  properties.$exception_issue_id AS issue_id,
  properties.$current_url AS current_url,
  properties.$pathname AS pathname,
  properties.channel AS channel,
  properties.scope AS scope,
  properties.$session_id AS session_id
FROM events
WHERE event = '$exception'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100
```

If PostHog tools are unavailable, say so explicitly — **blocked ≠ zero**. Do not fall back to browser UI unless the user asks.

### 3. Better Stack — top error patterns

1. Use the SQL rules from step 1 (collection names change; do not copy old SQL blindly).
2. Substitute a 24h window, e.g. `dt BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR AND now()`, and `environment = 'production'` when the column exists.
3. Rank by pattern count / last seen (LIMIT ~50).
4. Drill top patterns with `error` detail or exceptions SQL for stacks and structured fields (`surface`, `operation`, `correlationId`, `requestUrl`).

### 4. Correlate and cluster

Align PostHog issues with Better Stack patterns using, in order:

1. Same time slice
2. `correlationId`
3. `scope` + `operation`
4. `requestUrl` / route / `$pathname`
5. Stack top frames
6. `channel` (`frontend` vs `backend`)

Pull Better Stack Info logs only when Errors + PostHog are not enough to explain a cluster.

### 5. Separate noise

Call these out; do **not** treat as P0 product bugs by default:

- `SecurityError` + `posthog-recorder.js` / rrweb — session replay vs cross-origin iframes
- Bare `Script error.` — often WebKit / third-party CORS
- TradingView `[tv]` `no_such_symbol` / `Permission denied` / invalid symbol — widget lifecycle unless tied to bad app inputs
- Dynamic import / `Failed to fetch` / `Load failed` — often deploy skew, cache, or transport; note `app` vs `testapp` from URLs

### 6. Report (no implementation)

Use the template below. Name likely files/areas and the exact PostHog issue / Better Stack pattern signals that should drop after a fix. Stop there unless the user asks to implement.

## Deliverable template

1. **Window and sources** — `-24h`; PostHog project id; Better Stack Errors `application_id` + Info `source_id` actually used
2. **Summary** — 2–4 bullets: health, dominant themes, biggest risk
3. **PostHog — top issues** — title, issue id, counts/users/sessions, `channel` / route / scope
4. **Better Stack — top patterns** — pattern id, message/type, count in window
5. **Clusters** — group duplicates; mark noise vs product defects
6. **Root cause** — per cluster: hypothesis, confidence (high/medium/low), evidence
7. **Fix plan** — ordered, smallest safe change first; files/areas to inspect (not edits)
8. **Verification signals** — which issue UUIDs / pattern ids should drop after a fix
9. **Blockers** — MCP down, wrong PostHog project, missing logs, etc.

## MCP rules

1. Read live tool schemas before the first call.
2. Never invent counts, stacks, or issue ids — report blockers instead.
3. Summarize; cite PostHog issue UUIDs and Better Stack `pattern` ids.
4. Do not call Better Stack `update_error_state` (resolve/ignore) from this runbook.

## Better Stack SQL notes

1. Always refresh errors query instructions for the resolved `application_id` before writing SQL.
2. Prefer **metrics** aggregates for `-24h` ranking; use detail tools for stacks.
3. Cold exceptions S3 (`NAMED_COLLECTION_DOESNT_EXIST`) → prefer metrics + `error` detail; repair the Better Stack Telemetry cloud connection if historical exceptions are required (see observability rules).
4. Auth provisioning tags (e.g. `auth.provisioning.*`) live in the **Errors** application, not Info logs.

## Boundaries

- **Investigate only** unless the user expands scope after reviewing the plan.
- When evidence points at product behavior, follow webapp `AGENTS.md` read order before concluding about domain behavior.
- Do not treat product `frontend_error` events as a substitute for `$exception` / Better Stack operational triage.
